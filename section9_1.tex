	\subsection{Work sequence}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Implement one (to get satisfactory mark) or two (to get good mark) stages of your program from previous laboratory research.  Perform calculations on the CPU or the GPU (at your discretion, but the GPU is preferable).
		\item\textbf{Optional task (to get excellent mark).}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Complete tasks to get satisfactory and good mark.
				\item Calculate the confidence interval.
				\item Count time in 2 ways: using profiling and using usual metering (previous tasks).
				\item Evaluate the overhead.
				\item* Optional task for students with a lot of free time: Perform calculations together on the GPU and the CPU (i.e. iterations are divided in a certain proportion between the GPU and the CPU and performed simultaneously on them).
			\end{itemize}
		\item You may also write this laboratory research in CUDA.
	\end{enumerate}
